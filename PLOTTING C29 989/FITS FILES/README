This README file describes the files available. 

These data contain the full ALMA 1.3 mm (233 GHz) dust polarization results.   A full description of the data products and data imaging can be found in Sadavoy et al. (2019).

The data are available to download for individual target fields in 29 separate tar files.  There are 28 unique pointings and one mosaic field (c2d_1008).  Note that fields vla1623a & vla1623b and c2d_1008a & c2d_1008b each overlap, but only the c2d_1008a and c2d_1008b fields are mosaicked.  

There are 13 FITS images within each tar file using the same naming convention: FIELD_TYPE_233GHz (see below).  These FITS images contain the full data products and estimated errors.

All polarization products have been debiased.  All maps have been primary beam corrected.

For the error maps, we report statistical errors only.  The Stokes I, Q, and U error maps are obtained from their respective map rms scaled by the primary beam.  The error on polarization intensity is an average of the Stokes Q and U errors.  The error for polarization angle and polarization fraction are obtained from error propogation.
